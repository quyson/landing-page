In this project, I have learned to incorporate basic HTML, CSS, and Flexbox in order to create an optimal representation of a website's landing page. This includes a full on header and footer that are placed above and below the main content of the website. Additionally, flexbox was used extensively in order to create an aesthetically pleasing format and layout for the website. By dividing the website into multiple sections, I was able to better organize and compartmentalize different information into their respective locations. There is still alot more to learn, but I am excited to be on the right track in developing more engaging, and visually pleasing websites.
